# What it is

Discord bot created in order to keep me accountable for my daily fitness related tasks. \
Each day the bot checks if each goals has been completed. These goals are:

- `1h` gym session
- `1h` of cardio (can be soft, like walking)
- Less than `2100kcal` consumed
- More than `1000kcal` burned
- More than `2L` of water drank

If one of these goals is not met, the bot will mentionned the pre-determined winner and I will owe this person 5‚Ç¨.\
Each value is a variable and therefore can be changed at any time (depending on my objectives).
